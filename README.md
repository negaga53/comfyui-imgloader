# ComfyUI Universal Image Loader

A powerful and versatile custom node for ComfyUI that provides multiple ways to load images into your workflows.

## 🌟 Features

### Multiple Input Methods
- **📁 File Path**: Load images from your local file system using ComfyUI's file picker
- **📋 Base64**: Paste base64-encoded image strings directly into the node
- **🖼️ Clipboard Paste**: Copy images from anywhere and paste them directly onto the node
- **🎯 Drag & Drop**: Drag image files directly onto the node

### Smart Input Handling
- **Input Precedence**: When multiple inputs are provided (especially via API), the node follows a clear precedence order
- **Auto-clearing**: When you use one input method, other inputs are automatically cleared for clarity
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time preview and status indicators for loaded images
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with informative logging

### Advanced Features
- **EXIF Rotation**: Automatically applies correct image orientation based on EXIF data
- **Alpha Channel Support**: Properly extracts and processes alpha channels as masks
- **Memory Management**: Efficient GPU memory handling with automatic cleanup
- **Format Support**: Works with PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, and other common formats

## 📦 Installation

### Method 1: Git Clone (Recommended)
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
git clone https://github.com/your-username/comfyui-imgloader.git
```

### Method 2: Manual Download
1. Download this repository as a ZIP file
2. Extract to `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-imgloader/`
3. Restart ComfyUI

### Method 3: ComfyUI Manager
Search for "Universal Image Loader" in ComfyUI Manager and install.

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage
1. Add the node to your workflow: `Add Node` → `image` → `loaders` → `Image Loader (Universal)`
2. Choose your preferred input method:
   - **File Path**: Click the file selector and choose an image
   - **Base64**: Paste a base64 string into the text area
   - **Clipboard**: Copy an image and paste it directly onto the node (Ctrl+V)
   - **Drag & Drop**: Drag an image file onto the node

### Input Methods Details

#### 📁 File Path Input
- Uses ComfyUI's standard file picker
- Supports relative paths (resolved to `ComfyUI/input/` directory)
- Validates file existence and readability

#### 📋 Base64 Input
- Accepts both raw base64 strings and data URLs
- Supports format: `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo...`
- Or raw base64: `iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA...`
- Validates base64 format before processing

#### 🖼️ Clipboard Paste
- Copy any image from your browser, image editor, or file manager
- Focus the node and press Ctrl+V (or Cmd+V on Mac)
- Shows visual confirmation when an image is pasted
- Automatically converts to base64 format internally

#### 🎯 Drag & Drop
- Drag image files directly from your file manager
- Visual feedback with highlighting during drag operations
- Supports multiple files (uses the first image)

### API Usage

When using the ComfyUI API, you can provide multiple inputs. The node follows this precedence order:

1. **Clipboard/Pasted Image** (highest priority)
2. **File Path** (medium priority)  
3. **Base64 String** (lowest priority)

Example API payload:
```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "filepath": "my_image.png",
    "base64": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgA...",
    "pasted_base64": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo..."
  }
}
```

In this case, the `pasted_base64` input would be used.

## 🔧 Output

The node provides two outputs:
- **IMAGE**: Standard ComfyUI image tensor (NHWC format, float32, range 0-1)
- **MASK**: Alpha channel mask or fully opaque mask if no alpha is present

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
You can set these environment variables to customize behavior:

```bash
# Enable debug logging
export COMFYUI_IMGLOADER_DEBUG=1

# Set custom input directory (overrides ComfyUI default)
export COMFYUI_IMGLOADER_INPUT_DIR="/path/to/custom/input"
```

### Node Settings
The node automatically detects and handles:
- Image format and color space
- EXIF orientation data
- Alpha channel presence
- File path resolution

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No valid image source found"
- Ensure your image file exists and is readable
- Check that base64 strings are properly formatted
- Verify clipboard contains an image (not just a file path)

#### Paste not working
- Make sure the node is focused (click on it first)
- Try pasting directly onto the node canvas area
- Check browser permissions for clipboard access

#### Large images causing memory issues
- The node automatically manages GPU memory
- For very large images, consider resizing before input
- Monitor ComfyUI console for memory warnings

#### File path not found
- Relative paths are resolved to `ComfyUI/input/` directory
- Use absolute paths for files outside the input directory
- Check file permissions and accessibility

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting the environment variable:
```bash
export COMFYUI_IMGLOADER_DEBUG=1
```

This will provide detailed information about:
- Image loading operations
- Input precedence decisions
- Error details and stack traces
- Memory usage information
